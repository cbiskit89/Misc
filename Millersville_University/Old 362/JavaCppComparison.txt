1) Java includes many array features into a built in array class. Things that were possible
   in Java such as checking the size of an array are not possible in C++, so if an array was
   passed into a function, and you need to scan through the array you should pass the size
   as well. Java compilers also prevent programmers from going out of bounds, whereas C++
   will allow you to do so.

2) Structures and unions can be used similar to how classes in Java are used, but the
   difference is structures and unions in C++ can be used without creating a new class.
   They can be declared within the function that needs to use them. Unions can also prevent
   more memory than is needed from being used since they allow us to create a structure
   with one data type or another, but not both.

3) C++ does not use garbage collection. Programmers must use the delete operator to keep
   the program from using far more memory than it has to, which can be a huge problem.

4) Unlike Java, C++ allows programmers to pass by reference (or const-reference). This could
   be helpful to us if we need a function to change a value to the variable being passed in
   the original function that uses that variable. Java wouldn't allow us to change that
   because it could be considered dangerous or unsafe depending on how the variable is
   changed when it's being used by multiple functions. Passing by const-reference is also
   something that C++ allows that Java doesn't and could make programs more efficient by
   saving memory since there won't be a copy of a variable made.

5) Class members in Java are declared public or private individually. In C++, they are
   grouped. C++ also uses header files to show what functions and variables will be used in
   the class.

C++ is a good language for learning data structures and algorithms because it often times
forces the programmer to be aware of how memory is managed within our program as we try 
to find the most efficient solution to a problem.

Another good reason to use C++ is that it doesn't have as many restrictions as other
programming languages. C++ allows the programmer to run programs when the code may have
errors. Java would tell us not to do that, but C++ makes you find the solution yourself,
which is an important part of the learning curve in programming.
